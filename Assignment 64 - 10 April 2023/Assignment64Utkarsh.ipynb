    "### Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification problems. In this case, the algorithm extends the binary Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to the multi-class setting by using the \"one-vs-all\" (OvA) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the OvA approach, the multi-class problem is divided into multiple binary classification problems, with each class compared against all other classes. For example, if we have a problem with three classes (A, B, and C), we would train three binary classifiers: one to distinguish A from B and C, one to distinguish B from A and C, and one to distinguish C from A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### During classification, the algorithm calculates the probability of each document belonging to each class using the corresponding binary classifier. The document is assigned to the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Gaussian Naive Bayes, the likelihood probability is modeled using a Gaussian distribution for each feature in each class. The algorithm estimates the mean and variance of each feature in each class based on the training data. During classification, the algorithm calculates the probability of each document belonging to each class using the Gaussian distribution parameters for that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be a useful algorithm for multi-class classification problems when the features are continuous and can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution. However, it is important to note that it makes certain assumptions about the data (such as independence of features) that may not always hold in practice."
