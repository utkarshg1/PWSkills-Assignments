    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation: This is the mechanism of wrapping data and functions within a single unit (object) to protect the data from external access and modification. This helps to maintain the integrity of the data and the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: This is a mechanism of creating new classes (child classes) from existing classes (parent classes). The child classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of the parent class, and can also have their own unique attributes and behaviors. This helps to reduce code duplication and promote code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. This allows objects to be treated as objects of their parent class, while still retaining their unique behavior. This enables objects to be used interchangeably, reducing code complexity and improving code maintainability.\n",
