    "3. `Calinski-Harabasz Index`: The Calinski-Harabasz Index measures the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. Higher values of this index indicate better clustering.\n",

    "### While accuracy is a commonly used evaluation metric for classification tasks, there are some limitations to using it as the sole evaluation metric. Here are some of the limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Imbalanced classes`: When the distribution of classes in the dataset is imbalanced, accuracy can be a misleading metric. For example, if 95% of the samples in the dataset belong to one class, a model that always predicts that class will have 95% accuracy. However, this model may not be useful in practice. To address this limitation, alternative metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Cost-sensitive classification`: In some scenarios, the cost of misclassifying a sample from one class can be significantly higher than misclassifying a sample from another class. In these cases, accuracy alone may not be a sufficient metric. Instead, cost-sensitive evaluation metrics like weighted accuracy or weighted F1 score can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Multiclass classification`: In multiclass classification, accuracy may not provide enough information about the model's performance. For example, a model that performs well for one class but poorly for another may still have high accuracy. In this case, metrics like macro-averaged F1 score, micro-averaged F1 score, and confusion matrix can provide more detailed information about the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To address these limitations, it is recommended to use multiple evaluation metrics that complement each other. For example, using both accuracy and F1 score can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, it is important to consider the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand when selecting the evaluation metrics."
