    "1. A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching).\n",
    "2. Threading in python is used to run multiple threads (tasks, function calls) at the same time. Note that this does not mean that they are executed on different CPUs. Python threads will NOT make your program faster if it already uses 100 % CPU time. In that case, you probably want to look into parallel programming.\n",

    "### Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing different parts of the program to run simultaneously. This can make the program more efficient and reduce the overall execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Better resource utilization: Multithreading can make better use of available resources such as CPU and memory by distributing the workload across multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enhanced user experience: Multithreading can improve the user experience by making the program more responsive and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified coding: Multithreading can simplify coding by allowing the programmer to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: Multithreading allows the program to scale well as the number of threads can be increased based on the available resources."

    "\n",
    "2. Overhead: Multithreading adds overhead to the program as there is additional management overhead for creating, synchronizing, and managing threads.\n",

    "1. Deadlocks : A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource. In other words, each thread is holding a resource that the other thread needs to proceed, but neither thread can release its resource until it acquires the resource it is waiting for. This results in a situation where both threads are stuck, waiting indefinitely for the other thread to release the resource. Deadlocks can cause a program to hang or crash and are notoriously difficult to debug.\n",
    "2. Race Condition : A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the final outcome depends on the order in which the threads are executed. In other words, the execution of the program depends on the timing of the threads, and if the order of execution is not controlled, it can result in unpredictable behavior. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable simultaneously, the final value of the variable will depend on which thread executed first. This can result in incorrect program behavior, such as data corruption or inconsistency."

    "#### To avoid deadlocks and race conditions, it is important to ensure that the threads access shared resources in a thread-safe manner. This can be achieved using synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and mutexes, which allow only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. It is also important to design multithreaded programs carefully, avoiding shared resources wherever possible, and minimizing the time that a thread holds a lock to prevent deadlocks. Additionally, techniques such as thread prioritization and thread scheduling can be used to control the order of execution and avoid race conditions."
